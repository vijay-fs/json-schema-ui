# React i18next Playgrounds

This is a demo project to show how to use [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) with [React](https://reactjs.org/). It's a companion to a [Phrase blog tutorial](https://phrase.com/blog/posts/localizing-react-apps-with-i18next/).

## Running the demo

The demo is built with Vite. To run it locally, clone the repo and run `npm install` to install the dependencies. Then run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

You can also check out the [live demo without installing](https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/mdurmusphrase/react-i18next-iv).
